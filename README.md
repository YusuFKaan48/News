The news app, designed with a minimalist approach, not only delivers global news but also offers user-friendly filters for a personalized reading experience.

# Welcome and Onboarding part

When a user logs in for the first time, they are presented with the onboarding experience. After this initial display is complete, the user is automatically redirected to the main app upon subsequent logins. This seamless functionality is made possible through the use of User Defaults.

First-time example:

# Pull to refresh part

When the user wants to see the latest news or reset the search results, simply pull to refresh.

Pull to refresh example:

# Retrieve news for a specific country part

When you tap the world icon, a list of countries will appear, enabling you to choose the countries from which you'd like to receive the latest news. If you want to get news from all over the world again, just use the pull-to-refresh feature.

Switch the country example:

# Retrieve news for a specific category part

When you tap the filter icon, a list of categories will appear, allowing you to select your preferred category for receiving the latest news. To access news from all categories once more, simply use the pull-to-refresh feature.

Switch the category example:

# Search part

To start a search, click on the search icon in the tab bar to navigate to the search page. Once there, you can click on the search bar and enter your desired query. To reset the results, simply use the pull-to-refresh feature.

# Reading news part

After clicking on it to read the news, the program checks whether the URL is empty. If it is not empty, it redirects to the news page using the Safari View Controller.
